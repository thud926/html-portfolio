<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've spent nearly 20 years working in the industrial maintenance field, including turnaround work.
  I'm currently studying web development as a sideline and hope to transition to full-time developer in the near future.
</p>

<p>I'm relearning the fundamentals and updating my knowledge toward current requirements in web development.
  I believe one is never too old to learn if one is willing.
</p>

<p>I chose to replace the usual Lorem Ipsum with some actual information, as the course I'm working from advised to take this portfolio project seriously, so I have.
  I hope to be able to do this professionally soon.
